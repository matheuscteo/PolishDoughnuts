This example works both for a Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. 

Ready to plot:

The the Keplerian Orbits around a Schwarzschild (M=1) Black Hole (equatorial plane).\\ 

The effective potential for an accretion disk with l=3.75 (hand-picked to have an accretion disk with a cusp)\\

The accretion disk in 2D.\\

Changing l requires also to change the limits of second and third plot (vmax and vmin)
